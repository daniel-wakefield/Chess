This is a project that I developed in order to apply for an internship through the launch-code program.

The project is a chess game that you can play on your computer.

The driver class is called Chess.java, in order to play the game all you have to do is run that class.  It is in the Chess.src.com.chess
package.

The board starts with a standard chess board begining. Whenever you left-click on a piece that piece becomes selected and then you left 
click on where you want the piece to move and the piece moves there.  You are only allowed to move a piece to a legal spot.  If you click
on a illegal spot, or right click, the piece becomes deselected.

By default all of the possible legal moves are highlighted, however you can deselect this option in the options menu.

On the left side of the board, there is a panel that shows the taken pieces.

Whenever a king is in check, an alert icon shows up next to them.

And whenever a player wins by putting the other player in checkmate there is an alert notifying the players of the win.  There is also an
alert in the event of a stalemate.
